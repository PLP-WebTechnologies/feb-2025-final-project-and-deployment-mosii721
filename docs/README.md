My Blog Website
A responsive multi-page blog website built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, deployed on Netlify.
Features

Three Pages: Home (blog post previews), About, and Contact.
Responsive Design: Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox with media queries for mobile compatibility.
Interactivity: JavaScript-powered modal for blog post details and form validation on the Contact page.
Semantic HTML: Structured with <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, and <footer>.
Images: Uses royalty-free stock photos from Unsplash and Pexels, hosted online, with consistent sizing.
Icons: Social media and email links use Font Awesome icons for enhanced visuals.

Setup

Clone the repository: git clone <repo-url>
Open index.html in a browser to view locally.
Ensure css/styles.css and js/script.js are in the correct directories.
No local image assets are required, as images are sourced from Unsplash and Pexels.
Font Awesome is included via CDN for social media and email icons.

Replacing Images

Images are linked directly from Unsplash and Pexels under Creative Commons CC0 or Pexels License, allowing commercial use without attribution.
To replace an image, update the src attribute in the relevant <img> tag in index.html or about.html with a new URL from a royalty-free source (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay).
Ensure new images are high-resolution (e.g., 600x400px for blog posts, 150x150px for team headshots) with a 3:2 aspect ratio for blog posts to maintain consistency.

Deployment

Push the project to a GitHub repository.
Connect the repository to Netlify via the Netlify dashboard.
Deploy the site and access the live URL provided by Netlify.
